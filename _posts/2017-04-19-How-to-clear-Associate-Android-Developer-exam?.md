> Practical exam will be 48 hours long.

Google certification team will provide you the source code of one application and the list of tasks you need to perform. You need to complete those tasks before 48 hours and submit the application source code. These tasks are divided into three categories:

### **1\. Build some code from scratch.**

*   In these types of tasks, you have to develop some functionality in the application from the scratch. These tasks may ask you to develop some activity, create database structure or implement a content provider for the application.
*   To complete these tasks you will require a good knowledge of all the above-described topics. Also, it is very important that the code you write should follow proper coding guidelines and it doesn’t break any existing functionality.
*   Check the implemented functionality with edge cases (e.g. rotation changes, network conditions) before you submit your application code for review.

### **2\. Add new functionality to your existing code.**

*   These type of tasks ask you to build something upon the existing functionality. You will also find '_<span style="color: #919191;">//TODO</span>' _comments throughout the code provided while starting the exams. e.g. These tasks may ask you to create a table in existing database, display some list items in the existing activity using _RecyclerView_ etc.
*   To complete these type of tasks you must have sound knowledge of Android components. Also, you need to see that you don’t make any changes in the existing code or change the name of the classes/methods.
*   Check the functionality you worked on, thoroughly before submitting the code to review.

### **3\. Fix bugs in existing code and test the application.**

*   These tasks are specifically designed to check you testing and debugging skills. These tasks may ask you to fix some existing bugs in the application code and also ask you to write some espresso tests to test the application.
*   To complete these tasks, you must have knowledge of how to instrumentation and unit tests. You must know how to write test cases in espresso.
*   Before submitting your code it is advisable that you run your test cases and make sure that all tests are passing.

After completing all the tasks, upload your code in .zip format and submit the code for review. You will receive the result for the same within 45 days.

### **Exit interview:**

Once you pass the practice exam, certification team will ask you to choose your convenient time for the exit interview. This will be a chance for you to explain your work and your knowledge. The exit interview will be taken by one of the members from the certification team. It will be through a video call. You have to provide proof of your identity using any other government authorized identity card at the starting of the interview. After that, the interviewer will ask you to explain your work and the tasks you performed in the practical exam. The interviewer will also ask you some questions related to fundamentals of the Android to validate your skill level. The exit interview will take about 15 to 30 minutes. Once you complete the interview, you will receive the final result within a couple of weeks.
