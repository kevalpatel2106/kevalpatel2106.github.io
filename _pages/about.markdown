I am an Android Developer working on building beautiful and stunning Android applications for last 3 years. I am GoogleÂ certified Associate Android Developer. I also worked on some of the web technologies like Google App Engine and some of the emerging languages like GoLang.

I try to learn something new every day. Here on this website I write about the things I learned while exploring new things.
