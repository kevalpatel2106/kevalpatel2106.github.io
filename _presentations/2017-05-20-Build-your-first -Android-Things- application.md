Android Things is the new flavor of Android, that is specifically designed to run on different IoT devices. It is based on Android Nougat. Android Things supports various development devices like Raspberry PI, Intel Edison etc. It opens an opportunity to build Android applications for different IoT devices which have a wide variety of consumer, retail, and industrial use cases.

In this talk, I talked about what is Android Things and how you can build applications with it. I also gave the basic introduction to Raspberry Pi. Lastly, we will see how easy it is to connect with Googleâ€™s Firebase infrastructure and use it to communicate with other devices.
